# sports-crud

This is a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) app built in PHP for a school sports competition, initially built in 2016, and improved on in 2018. Includes  points tally, awards, tabulation and final results dashboard as well. Built using rudimentary **PHP**, **CSS** and **MySQL**. Documentation and certification can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ObKKHioXFmHKC7UD4_BKSotKDg-XKTy "Drive Documentation")


## Steps for using the project
1. Clone the repository using `git clone`
2. Import `sports.sql` into your localhost MySQL database
3. Change the parameters of `conn.php` as needed (eg, password, username, root).
4. Change the CSS files for customisation (a lightweight template can be found [here](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/snippets/preview.php?topic=bootstrap&file=crud-data-table-for-database-with-modal-form "Template")
5. You're done! This project can be modified into a awards tabulation system for any sports, academic or extra-curricular event.
